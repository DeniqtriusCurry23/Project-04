If the the user has already created a account he will be taken to his account home page. Once there he will see his profile picture on the top left and all of his connections under it. In the middle of his screen will be a prompt asking him to describe his dream.  Once the user has sumbited his input then he will be notified if anyone else has had the same dream. If so then they will both be notified that a match has occured and on what dream. They will be connected only for 24 hours before everything resets.
