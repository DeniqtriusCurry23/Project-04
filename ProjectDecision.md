# Project Proposal

I will be introducing the project i wil be working on for the remainder of this course . The decision process was extremly virgorus because of the fact that i had no idea of what i wanted to work on . The first step was to decide what i wouldnt mind working on and applying most of my time to . The second greatest challenge was to figure out if i would even be capable of completing such a task by my self . They say knowing is half the battle and i wholeheartedly believe that to be true because without knowing its hard to do anything . The project that i will be completing will be an application that will be on regular computers and even laptops . 
###### Explanation of App
The application will be named Dream connect as a  fancy play on words regarding the actual nature of the application . At the application's highest level of funcationality the task that it should be able to complete will be a fully connected database of information . This database will use keywords taken by user input to create links between people . At full funcationality the application will be able to link two or more people in an instant , solely based off of what they have inputed in to the application . The keywords inside the database would act similar to a primary key inside of an SQL table . Once the keyword or primary key has been called upon the database will look for other people within a specific time frame that have also used that keyword . It wont stop there though , the more primary keys or keywords used the stronger the connection or link between two people or a group will be . Enough of the same keywords would result in a match between a pair or even a group . After this has taken place the two people or group will be able to chat with one another and talk about why this has taken place . So this does make it similar to a social media application the only differes that people will not be able to be friends or anything of that sort on the application .
###### More Explanation
Working with this application will be kind of tricky i know i willl enjoy the friuts of my labor but i will have to outline the potential problems that may arise as i begin trying to create this project . First of all i have absolutely no idea where to start . I know that i want to create this application using visual studios . I will have to start with a blank app and create a title or cover page for the application which is the first thing you will see when opening the application . While creating this title page im going to have to input  two button blocks and also to text blocks . The cover page should look similar to other social media pages when your prompted to sign in the application.  If the user doesnt have an account then they will be prompted to sign in . Basic information will be required to sign up and the user will be required to be atleast 18 years of age . Once they have created a profile or have signed in they will be prompted with an text block requesting what they have dreamed about . 
##### More Explanation
Once they have entered what they have dreamed about then the process begins . The statement goes in to the text box as a string and is scanned for keywords that have been specified as words to look for . The time from when you enter a string untill you have been matched with someone that has had the same the dream or a similar dream then you have had . This application could potentially change the way we see how we dream and how it works . To imagine that you can meet someone in your dream that you have never met before in real life is amazing . This application has extreme potential and is the exact reason why im willing to put in the maximum time to complete it . 
##### Conclusion 
To think that creating any one of these application's would be easy is crazy to believe . I surveyed each and every one of the projects that were proposed by my classmates and the proffessor and all of them are going to be vigorus for us new programmers . I am really looking forward to watching this application grow and become what i imagine it will be . This application will blur the lines between celebritys rich and poor because you can meeet anyone that you have had a similar dream with.
